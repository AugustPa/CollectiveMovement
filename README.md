# CollectiveMovement: A Unity-Based Simulation of Collective Animal Behavior

## Overview

The `collectiveMovement` repository contains a Unity-based simulation framework for modeling the collective behavior of animals, such as fish schools and bird flocks. This project aims to provide a versatile tool for studying and visualizing the complex dynamics of collective behavior in a virtual environment.

## Features

- Simulation of collective animal movement through separation, alignment, and cohesion.
- Customizable parameters for different behaviors.
- Real-time visualization of individual and collective movement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity (Version XYZ or later)
- Basic understanding of Unity's interface and scripting in C#

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Load the main scene to start experimenting with the simulation.

## Usage

### Components

#### Fish

- Represents an individual fish in the school.
- Handles individual behavior calculations and movement updates.

#### Simulation

- Manages the overall simulation environment.
- Initializes and maintains the school of fish.

### Customization

- Adjust the number of fish and their behavior weights in the `Simulation` script.
- Experiment with different parameters to observe varied collective behaviors.
